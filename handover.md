# Handover

**AI-managed file — humans should not edit this directly.** The agent keeps current state and next steps here.

## Current Focus
- No queued feature work; maintain prompt cleanup rule and await new tasks.

## State Snapshot
  - Governance files exist and todos are clear: `todo-inbox.md` holds template text only; `todo.md` now includes prompt execution tasks; `backlog.md` is empty; bugs are empty.
- UI intent protocol concept is under `concepts/ui-intent-protocol/` with schema, adapter, reference renderer, and PDCA doc; Skill `skills/ui-intent-emit/` added for validated intent emission.
- Workflow snapshots are stored locally under `ai_workflow_revisions/` (gitignored by default); current baseline `rev_008_current` was captured via `scripts/create-workflow-revision.sh` (see `docs/workflow-revisions.md` for required contents/numbering).
- Key references: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agents.md`, `docs/humans/workflow-guide.md`, `docs/context-management.md`, `docs/security.md`, `docs/access-manifest.md`, `docs/skills/skill-library-v1.md`, `specs/skill-library-v1.md`, `scripts/skillctl`, and `skills/README.md`.
- Upstream metadata catalog for agent selection: `docs/skills/upstream-skillcards.anthropic.json`.
- `skillctl` setup script creates `.venv-skillctl/` (ignored by git via `.gitignore`).
- Stack profiles live under `docs/stacks/` (Node, Python, Go, React/TS, Java/Spring, Rust, Data/ML, .NET, PHP, Mobile, Next.js, SvelteKit, Vue/Nuxt, React Native, Flutter, Electron/Tauri, R, PySpark, Julia, Rails, Django/DRF, FastAPI, serverless variants, C/C++, Elixir, Kotlin, Scala, Terraform, Ansible, Angular, Remix, Cloudflare Workers, Deno/Fresh, Unity, WordPress).
- AgentFS enforcement artifacts live under `docs/agentfs/` with the governing spec in `specs/agentfs-enforcement-layer-v1.md`.

## Active Skills and Recent Changes
- Skill scaffolding exists under `skills/_template/` and the contract schema is `skills/_schema/skill.schema.json`; implemented Skills: `skills/fs-hash-tree/`, `skills/skillcard-parse/`, and `skills/skillcard-index/`.
- Added Skill `ui_intent.emit` under `skills/ui-intent-emit/` for UI intent validation (Spec ID: `d520edbb-18e7-4b29-834c-6756329b2c81`).

## Next Steps
- Maintain pre/post-task sweeps of `todo-inbox.md`; keep todos/backlog/completed/handover agent-managed.
- When modifying workflow/governance docs, create the next local `ai_workflow_revisions/rev_00X_current` snapshot (per `docs/workflow-revisions.md`) and log the revision in `completed.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `handover.md`.
- Record new work in the planner ledger (`docs/context/planner-task-manager.md`) before coding and close entries with outcomes.
- If needed, run the UI intent Skill smoke test (`skills/ui-intent-emit/tests/test_smoke.sh`) or `scripts/skillctl validate --all`.
- Implement AgentFS runtime enforcement per `specs/agentfs-enforcement-layer-v1.md`, starting with Phase 1 PDCA gating.

## Pending Items
- None.
